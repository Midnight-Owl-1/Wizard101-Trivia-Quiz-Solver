# Wizard101 Trivia Quiz Solver
- This is a program that will automatically log into your Wizard101 account, and complete your 10 trivia quizzes, to help you easily collect your 100 daily free Crowns.
- This is "Semi-automated" because the program can not do the CAPTCHA by itself. It will prompt (with a beep) you when you need to complete the CAPTCHA.

# Setup
- In the "Releases" section on this Github page, download the zip file for the latest release
- Unzip the contents of the zip file into a folder on your computer (ex. a new folder on the Desktop)
- In the account.txt file, enter your username and password (replacing the spots with xxx)
- Now you are able to run the program by double-clicking the "Wizard101 Quiz Solver.exe" file

# Instructions of Use
- Start the program by double clicking the "Wizard101 Quiz Solver.exe" file
- Press the "Start" button on the GUI window that pops up. This will open up an automated Google Chrome window
- The browser will try to automatically log in with your credentials. The GUI window will ask you if there is CAPTCHA to complete
- The browser will automatically go to a quiz link, and start answering the questions
- When a quiz is completed, you will hear a beep, and the GUI window will prompt you to complete the CAPTCHA before pressing continue
- It will continue this way until all quizzes for the day are completed

# Things to Note
- This program only works on the Windows operating system with Google chrome installed
- It takes about 13 minutes to complete the 10 quizes for one day (getting you 100 Crowns)
- Understand that since Wizard101 Crowns cost $5USD for 2500, you're effectivly doing this for 92 cents/hour
